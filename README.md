# The House of Health
# HACKMERCED IV - *WebApp*
Submitted by: **Francisco Lira, Joshua Phelps, Adrian Buitron and Carl**

**The House of Health** is a friendly tool/webapp for non-savvy in technology users to help them find essential resources against mental illness. Unfortunately, elderly people are very vulnerable to isolation, which causes mental issues, given the current circumstances due to the novel Covid-19 pandemic. To contrast these issues, our developers have constructed a simple but highly effective survey that re-directs people to the right resources and help they need. It is an innovative, but simple solution for inclusivity and social good.
